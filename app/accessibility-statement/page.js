          <br />
          Any employee, applicant, or member of the public with a disability
          (Complainant) who believes TrustEdge Logistics ICT is inaccessible in violation of
          Section 508 may file an informal complaint. If the Complainant is not
          satisfied with the response to the informal complaint, then the
          Complainant may file a formal complaint. Informal Complaint. A

          discrimination or inaccessibility of Delivery programs, activities, or
          ICT. Likewise, an applicant must inform the selecting official, and a
          member of the public must inform the responsible Delivery manager of
          the inaccessibility. If the matter cannot be resolved within 30 days
          of its receipt by the delivery manager or official, the Complainant
          should receive an interim status report. On or before the 60th day
          from the agency&apos;s receipt of the informal complaint, the
          appropriate Delivery Service area or functional vice president will
          send a written decision to the Complainant detailing the disposition
          of the informal complaint. Formal Complaint. If an informal complaint
          is denied relief, the Complainant may seek relief in any other
          appropriate forum, including the right to file a formal complaint with
          the Vice President and Consumer Advocate in accordance with the
          following procedures. If the Complainant files a formal complaint with
          the Vice President and Consumer Advocate, the Complainant shall
          exhaust the formal complaint procedures before filing suit in any
          other forum. A formal complaint must be filed within 30 days of the
          date the Complainant receives the decision of the area/functional vice
          president denying relief. Formal complaints must be sent to the Vice
          President and Consumer Advocate at the following Headquaters
