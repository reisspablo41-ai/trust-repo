          What sets us apart: Our nearly 500,000 difference-makers
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our team members are deep-down dedicated to our Purple Promise — to
          make every TrustEdge Logistics experience outstanding. They prove it by going the
          extra mile (sometimes literally). Engaging with each other to find
          creative, innovative ways to solve customer problems. And displaying a
          work ethic that just won&apos;t quit. No matter where you look — from
          Memphis to Mumbai, Dublin to Dubai, Botswana to Brazil — we&apos;re
          working to provide a safe, inclusive, and rewarding place to work.
          Where growth and learning are prioritized. Employee successes are
          celebrated. And team members are delivering hope, change, and new
          possibilities to people everywhere.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-4xl my-10">Our people-first culture</h3>
        <p>
          Creating an exceptional workplace means caring about more than our
          company&apos; success. It means prioritizing our people. Recognizing
          next-level effort. Prizing diversity. Enabling innovation. And rolling
          up our sleeves to help the people around us. That leads to outstanding
          customer experiences.
